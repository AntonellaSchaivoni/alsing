#Syntax highlight editor for Windows Forms 2.0+

===History===
The *SyntaxBox* is a very only project of mine.
It started back in 2002 when me and my brother formed the company *Compona*
Our aim was to sell components over the internet.
Our first product was the Compona SyntaxBox and it was pretty much an instant success as there were very few competing products at that time.

Since we ran our company on our sparetime and I was the only developer of the SyntaxBox, I ended up with a bit too many support cases.
After a few years I had to give it up because I had virtually no free time of my own anymore.

In 2005 the project was turned into opensource and released on [http://puzzleframework.com].
And it have been hibernating there ever since.

However, due to public request I am now kicking some life into it again.
I have converted the entire project to C#3 and cleaned up the code and API quite a bit.

The new source compiles for .NET 2.0 (requires VS.NET 2008 due to the C#3 code base)
